The goal of this project is to connect architecture documentation and models while identifying missing or deviating elements (inconsistencies). More information can be found [here](https://ardoco.github.io/).

ArDoCo is actively developed by researchers of the _[Modelling for Continuous Software Engineering (MCSE) group](https://mcse.kastel.kit.edu)_ of _[KASTEL - Institute of Information Security and Dependability](https://kastel.kit.edu)_ at the [KIT](https://www.kit.edu).
