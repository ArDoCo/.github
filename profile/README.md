The goal of this project is to connect architecture documentation and models for different purposes like traceability link recovery and identifying inconsistencies (e.g. missing or deviating elements). More information can be found at the [research group's project site](https://mcse.kastel.kit.edu/Projects_ArDoCo.php) and at the [home page](https://ardoco.de/).

To start, have a look at the [Core framework](https://github.com/ArDoCo/Core/) as well as its [Wiki](https://github.com/ArDoCo/Core/wiki).

ArDoCo is actively developed by researchers of the _[Modelling for Continuous Software Engineering (MCSE) group](https://mcse.kastel.kit.edu)_ of _[KASTEL - Institute of Information Security and Dependability](https://kastel.kit.edu)_ at the [KIT](https://www.kit.edu).
